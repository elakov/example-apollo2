# ApolloClient + graphql-code-generator

Example of type generation in relay-compiler manner.

NOTE: `__generated__` folders should be excluded from version control! In this repo they are added for demo purposes (without run we can see what generated and disscus it).

If you use VSCode, please install [Apllo GraphQL plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo). It greatly improve DX when you working with `.graphql` files. This project already has properly configured `apollo.config.js`.
